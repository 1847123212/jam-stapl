Altera Jam STAPL Player with support for 64-bit Windows versions.

Changes with respect to v2.5 from Altera:
  * VS2013 solution added (for 32-bit and 64-bit builds)
  * Uses the Inpout32 driver library (v1.5.0.0) for parallel port access. (See also http://www.highrez.co.uk/Downloads/InpOut32/)

Run jam.exe the first time with administrator permissions to install and load the Inpout32 driver.
